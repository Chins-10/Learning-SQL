# Learning-SQL
Hi!
I'm learning to code, interested in data analytics and data science, aiming to be hired by end of 2024.
This repository is for SQL exercises done by me while learning SQL on various platforms and courses.
List of course:
1. Learn SQL --on [codecademy.com](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-sql)
2. SQL excercises -- by [Aptech Staffing](https://www.aptechstaffing.com/courses/)
3. MySQL tutorial -- by [w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/mysql/default.asp)

It's extremely important to write a readable code. Please, read and follow SQL style guide. I personally enjoyed this one by Louis Davidson you can find it here: https://www.dropbox.com/sh/n65xs2ia2m0t8kq/AAAQXUaAhN0HIG8ypKV884vka?dl=0&preview=Exam+Ref+70-762+Developing+SQL+Databases.pdf

Hope this repo will help you to assess my SQL skills or will be just fun for you to look through.
